Comparing drug and search rates
As you saw in the last exercise, the rate of drug-related stops increased significantly between 2005 and 2015. You might hypothesize that the rate of vehicle searches was also increasing, which would have led to an increase in drug-related stops even if more drivers were not carrying drugs.

You can test this hypothesis by calculating the annual search rate, and then plotting it against the annual drug rate. If the hypothesis is true, then you'll see both rates increasing over time.

# Calculate and save the annual search rate
annual_search_rate = ri.search_conducted.resample('A').mean()

# Concatenate 'annual_drug_rate' and 'annual_search_rate'
annual = pd.concat([annual_drug_rate,annual_search_rate], axis='columns')

# Create subplots from 'annual'
annual.plot(subplots=True)

# Display the subplots
plt.show()
