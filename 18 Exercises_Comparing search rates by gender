Comparing search rates by gender
In this exercise, you'll compare the rates at which female and male drivers are searched during a traffic stop. Remember that the vehicle search rate across all stops is about 3.8%.

First, you'll filter the DataFrame by gender and calculate the search rate for each group separately. Then, you'll perform the same calculation for both genders at once using a .groupby()

# Calculate the search rate for female drivers
print(ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F'].search_conducted.mean())

# Calculate the search rate for male drivers
print(ri[ri.driver_gender == 'M'].search_conducted.mean())

# Calculate the search rate for both groups simultaneously
print(ri.groupby(['driver_gender']).search_conducted.mean())
