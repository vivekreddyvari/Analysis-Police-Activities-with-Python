Examining traffic violations
Before comparing the violations being committed by each gender, you should examine the violations committed by all drivers to get a baseline understanding of the data.

In this exercise, you'll count the unique values in the violation column, and then separately express those counts as proportions.

# Count the unique values in 'violation'
print(ri.violation.value_counts())

# Express the counts as proportions
print(ri.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
