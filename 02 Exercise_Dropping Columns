Dropping columns
Often, a DataFrame will contain columns that are not useful to your analysis. Such columns should be dropped from the DataFrame, to make it easier for you to focus on the remaining columns.

In this exercise, you'll drop the county_name column because it only contains missing values, and you'll drop the state column because all of the traffic stops took place in one state (Rhode Island). Thus, these columns can be dropped because they contain no useful information.

# Count the number of missing values in each column
print(ri.isnull().sum())

# Examine the shape of the DataFrame
print(ri.shape)

# Drop the 'county_name' and 'state' columns
ri.drop(['county_name', 'state'], axis='columns', inplace=True)

# Examine the shape of the DataFrame (again)
print(ri.shape)
