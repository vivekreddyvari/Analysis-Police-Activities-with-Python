Plotting the hourly arrest rate
In this exercise, you'll create a line plot from the hourly_arrest_rate object. A line plot is appropriate in this case because you're showing how a quantity changes over time.

This plot should help you to spot some trends that may not have been obvious when examining the raw numbers!
# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a line plot of 'hourly_arrest_rate'
hourly_arrest_rate.plot()

# Add the xlabel, ylabel, and title
plt.xlabel('Hour')
plt.ylabel('Arrest Rate')
plt.title('Arrest Rate by Time of Day')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
