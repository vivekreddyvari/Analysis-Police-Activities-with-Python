How long might you be stopped for violation?

-  translate strings to data
-  apple.stock prices
Analysing an object columns
 - Create a Boolean column: True if the price went up, and False otherwise
 - Calculate how often the price went up by taking the column 'mean'

apple.change.dtype
dtype('O')
astype() can't be used in this case

Mapping one set of values to another (Map method)
step1 - Dictionary maps the values you have to the values you want
step2 - mapping = {'up':True, 'down':False}
step3 - apple['is_up'] = apple.change.map(mapping)
step4 - pple.is_up.mean() (0.5)

Calculating the search rate
step1  - Visualize how often searches were performed after each type of violation
step2  - ri.groupby('violation').search_conducted.mean()
 - Returns a Series sorted in alphabetical order
 search_rate.plot(kind='bar')
 plt.show()
