Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?

Filtering by multiple conditions(1)
 
 # to create the dataframe of only female driver
 female = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F']
 female.shape
 gives the number of rows
 
 # to created the female driver only arrested
 female_and_arrested = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') & (ri.is_arrested == True)]
  - each condition is represented by parenthesis ()
  - and & ampersand operator is 'and' condition
  
Filtering by multiple conditions(2)
  # to create the data frame with pipe-character or logical OR '|'
  female_or_arrested = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') | (ri.is_arrested == True)]
 
Rules for filtering by multiple conditions.
  - Ampersand (&) only when two conditions satisfy
  - Pipe (|) includes rows that satisfy either condition.
  - Each conditions must be separated by paranthesis
  - conditions can check equality (==) or not equality (!=)
  - can use more than two conditions.

Correlation and Causation
 - Analyse the relationship between gender and stop outcome
 - Assess whether there is a correlation 
 - no causation required
