Rating the weather conditions
In the previous exercise, you counted the number of bad weather conditions each day. In this exercise, you'll use the counts to create a rating system for the weather.

The counts range from 0 to 9, and should be converted to ratings as follows:

Convert 0 to 'good'
Convert 1 through 4 to 'bad'
Convert 5 through 9 to 'worse'

# Count the unique values in 'bad_conditions' and sort the index
print(weather.bad_conditions.value_counts().sort_index())

# Create a dictionary that maps integers to strings
mapping = {0:'good', 1:'bad', 2:'bad', 3:'bad', 4:'bad', 5:'worse', 6: 'worse', 7:'worse', 8:'worse', 9:'worse'}

# Convert the 'bad_conditions' integers to strings using the 'mapping'
weather['rating'] = weather.bad_conditions.map(mapping)

# Count the unique values in 'rating'
print(weather.rating.unique())
