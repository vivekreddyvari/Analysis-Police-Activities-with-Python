Notes Taken:
Analysing Police Activities with Pandas
 - Standford Open Policing Project Dataset
* Introduction to the dataset
 - Traffic stops by police officers
 
* Prepare the data for analysis
1) Examine the Data
2) clean the data

import pandas as pd
ri = pd.read_csv('police.csv')

each row represent one stop
Locating Missing Values:
 df.isnull () gives the missing values, the missing values is indicate by true/False
  - True shows the values are present
  - False shoes the values are NOT present
  ri.isnull()
  
- df.isnull.sum()
give the sum of the dataframe
 - shows the count which values are not present
 - shows the 0 for values present
 - shows the values (represent count in number )for values not present 

-  df.shape
 - gives the columns with rows count which have missing values.

the null columns can be dropped with drop method.
- df.drop('Colname', axis='columns', inplace=True)

dropna() method is good while dropping the missing values
df.dropna(subset=['colname1', 'colname2'], inplace=True)
