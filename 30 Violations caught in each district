What violations are caught in each district?
 - computing frequency table.
 - crosstab function.
   * cross tabulations
   * Frequency table : Tallies of how many times each combinations of values occurs

# cross tab
pd.crosstab(ri.driver_race, ri.driver_gender)

- other traditional way of knowing or finding is stretchy 
 - how many female asian-drivers were stopped?
	 - ri[(ri.driver_race == 'Asian') & (ri.driver_gender == 'F')].shape
		(551, 14)
 - driver_race is along the index, driver_gender is along the columns
