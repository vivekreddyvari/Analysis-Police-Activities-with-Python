Searching for a string

ri['inventory'] = ri.search_type.str.contains('Inventory', na=False)
 - str.contains() returns True if string is found, False if not found
 - na=False returns False when it finds a missing value

ri.inventory.dtype
dtype('bool')
True means an inventory was done, False means it was not

Calculate the percentage of searches, i.e. Calculating the inventory rate

# wrong way of calculating the search.
ri.inventory.mean()
0.0050961449570121106 
0.5% of all traffic stops resulted in an inventory

# first find the true condition, then apply mean on it 
 searched = ri[ri.search_conducted == True]
searched.inventory.mean()
0.13335349259147264
13.3% of searches included an inventory
