Fixing a data type
We saw in the previous exercise that the is_arrested column currently has the object data type. In this exercise, we'll change the data type to bool, which is the most suitable type for a column containing True and False values.

Fixing the data type will enable us to use mathematical operations on the is_arrested column that would not be possible otherwise.

# Examine the head of the 'is_arrested' column
print(ri.is_arrested.dtype)

# Check the data type of 'is_arrested'
print(ri.is_arrested.dtype)

# Change the data type of 'is_arrested' to 'bool'
ri['is_arrested'] = ri.is_arrested.astype('bool')

# Check the data type of 'is_arrested' (again)
print(ri.is_arrested.dtype)
