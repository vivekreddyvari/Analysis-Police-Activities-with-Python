Changing the data type to category
Since the rating column only has a few possible values, you'll change its data type to category in order to store the data more efficiently. You'll also specify a logical order for the categories, which will be useful for future exercises.

# Create a list of weather ratings in logical order
cats = ['good','bad','worse']

# Change the data type of 'rating' to category
weather['rating'] = weather.rating.astype('category', ordered=True, categories=cats)

# Examine the head of 'rating'
print(weather.rating.head())
