Preparing the DataFrames
In this exercise, you'll prepare the traffic stop and weather rating DataFrames so that they're ready to be merged:

With the ri DataFrame, you'll move the stop_datetime index to a column since the index will be lost during the merge.
With the weather DataFrame, you'll select the DATE and rating columns and put them in a new DataFrame.

# Reset the index of 'ri'
ri.reset_index(inplace = True)

# Examine the head of 'ri'
print(ri.head())

# Create a DataFrame from the 'DATE' and 'rating' columns
weather_rating = weather[['DATE','rating']]

# Examine the head of 'weather_rating'
print(weather_rating.head())
