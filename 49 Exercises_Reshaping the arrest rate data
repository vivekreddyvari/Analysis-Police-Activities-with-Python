Reshaping the arrest rate data
In this exercise, you'll start by reshaping the arrest_rate Series into a DataFrame. This is a useful step when working with any multi-indexed Series, since it enables you to access the full range of DataFrame methods.

Then, you'll create the exact same DataFrame using a pivot table. This is a great example of how pandas often gives you more than one way to reach the same result!

# Unstack the 'arrest_rate' Series into a DataFrame
print(arrest_rate.unstack())

# Create the same DataFrame using a pivot table
print(ri_weather.pivot_table(index='rating', columns='violation', values='is_arrested'))
