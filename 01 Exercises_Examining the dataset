Throughout this course, you'll be analyzing a dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project.

Before beginning your analysis, it's important that you familiarize yourself with the dataset. In this exercise, you'll read the dataset into pandas, examine the first few rows, and then count the number of missing values.

# Import the pandas library as pd
import pandas as pd

# Read 'police.csv' into a DataFrame named ri
ri = pd.read_csv('police.csv')

# Examine the head of the DataFrame
print(ri.head())

# Count the number of missing values in each column
print(ri.isnull().sum())
